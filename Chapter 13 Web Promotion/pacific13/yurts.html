		<h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
		<dl>
			<dt>What is a yurt?<dd>
			<dd>
				Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is <br/>
				fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be <br/>
				opened.
			</dd>
			<dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt>
			<dd>
				Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed down quilt and gas-fired stove. <br/>
				Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold <br/>
				running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.
			</dd>
			<dt>What should I bring?</dt>
			<dd>
				Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing<br/>
				weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense <br/>
				of adventure!<br/>
