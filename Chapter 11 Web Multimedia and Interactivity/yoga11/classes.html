		<h2>Relax Anytime with Savasana</h2>
		<p>
			Prepare yourself for savasana. Lie down on your yoga may with your arms at your side with palms up. Close your eyes<br>
			and breathe slowly but deeply. Sink into the mat and let your worries slip away. When you are ready, roll on your side<br>
			and use your arms to push yourself to a sitting position with cross legs. Place your hands in a prayer position. Be<br>
			grateful for all that you have in life. Namaste.
