		<h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
		<dt>
			<strong>
				What is a yurt?
			</strong>
			<dd>
				Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is </br>
				fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be </br>
				opened.
			</dd>
			<strong>
				How are the yurts furnished?
			</strong>
			<dd>
				Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed down quilt and gas-fired stove. </br>
				Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold </br>
				running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.
			</dd>
			<strong>
				What should I bring?
			</strong>
			<dd>
				Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing</br>
				weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense </br>
				of adventure!</br>
